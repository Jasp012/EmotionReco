# EmotionReco with RAF_DB

Detailed info on RAF_DB dataset can be found at : http://www.whdeng.cn/raf/model1.html

Real-world Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB) is a large-scale facial expression database with around 30K great-diverse facial images downloaded from the Internet. Based on the crowdsourcing annotation, each image has been independently labeled by about 40 annotators. Images in this database are of great variability in subjects' age, gender and ethnicity, head poses, lighting conditions, occlusions, (e.g. glasses, facial hair or self-occlusion), post-processing operations (e.g. various filters and special effects), etc. RAF-DB has large diversities, large quantities, and rich annotations, including:

* 29672 number of real-world images

* a 7-dimensional expression distribution vector for each image,

* two different subsets: single-label subset, including 7 classes of basic emotions; two-tab subset, including 12 classes of compound emotions,

* 5 accurate landmark locations, 37 automatic landmark locations, bounding box, race, age range and gender attributes annotations per image,

* baseline classifier outputs for basic emotions and compound emotions.

To be able to objectively measure the performance for the followers' entries, the database has been split into a training set and a test set where the size of training set is five times larger than test set, and expressions in both sets have a near-identical distribution.
